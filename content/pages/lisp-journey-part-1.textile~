h1. Lisp overview

# The interactive front end of the Lisp system is known as **toplevel**
# Numbers in lisp evaluates to itself
# Lisp uses **prefix** notation where operator precededes the arguments
## **Infix** notation requires exactly 2 arguments, but prefix one can take any number of arguments, including none 
# function call evaluation rule in lisp
## The arguments are evaluated from left to right
## The values of the arguments are passed to the function
## If any of the arguments are function calls, they are evaluated according to the above rules
# **quote** operator is an example for an operator that does not follow the above evaluation rule
## It has special evaluation rule of its own
## And the rule is **do nothing**
## **'** is an abbreviation for **quote**
# Integers and Strings in Lisp evaluates to themselves
# **Symbols** are words and ordinarly they are converted to uppercase 
## symbols do not evaluate to themself
# Lists are represented as two or more elements enclosed in parantheses
## Elements could be of any type including lists
## Should quote lists, in order to avoid function call
## Quote protects the whole expression, including the nested ones
# **list** function could be used for building lists
## As list is a function its arguments are evaluated
# Two ways to represent the empty list
## As a pair of parentheses with nothing bewteen them
## Use the symbol **nil**
# **cons** builds lists
## Adds the first argument to the front of the list if the second argument is a list
## list function is a convenient way to cons several things in to nil
# **car** and **cdr** could be used for extracting things from a list
## car of the list is the first element
## cdr is everything after the first element
## by using combination of car and cdr any element could be extracted
# symbol **t** is the default representation for truth
## like nil, t evaluates to itself
## A function whose return value is indended to be interpreted as truth or falsity, is called **predicate**. Example is **listp**
## Falsity is represented by **nil**
### nil plays two roles in lisp
### **null** function returns true of the empty list
### **not** function returns true if its argument is false
# The simplest conditional is **if**
## Usually takes three arguments
### A test expression
### A then expression
### An else expression
## like quote, if is a special operator
## last argument is optional, and defaults to nil
## Although **t** is the default reprsesentation of trueth, everything except **nil** also counts as true in a logical context
# logical operators **and** and **or** resemble conditionals
## Both take any number of arguments, but only evaluate as many as they need
## If all the arguments are true, **and** returns the value of the last one
### If one of the arguments turn out to be false, none of the arguments after that get evaluated
## **or** stops as soon as it finds an argument that is true
## These two are **macros**

# **defun** can be used for creating new functions
## Usually takes three or more arguments
### A name
### A list of parameters
### One or more body expressions
## A symbol used as a placeholder is called variable
### When a variable represents argument to a function, it is called parameter
# Lisp makes no distinction between a program, a procedure, and a function

# A function that calls itself is **recursive**
# The predicate **eql** tests whether its two arguments are identical

# The most general output function is **format**
## Takes two or more arguments
### first indicates where the output is to be printed
### second is a string template
#### **~A** indicates a position to be filled
#### **~%** indicates a new line
### remaining are the objects whose string representations need to be inserted in the template

# The standard function for input is **read**
## When given no arguments, it reads from the default place
## read is a complete lisp parser

# **let** introduces local variables
## It has two parts
### first is the instructions for creating variables of the form **(variable expression)**
### second is the body, consisting of expression(s)

# global variables are visible everywhere
## **defparameter** creates global variables
## **defconstant** also creates global variables
## It is convention to begin and end gobal variable with asterisk (*)
## **boundp** can be used to check whether some symbol is the name of a global variable or constant


# The most common assignment operator is **setf**
## It can assign to either set of variables
## It will create implicit global varibales
## First argument can be an expression instead of a name
### In such cases, the value of the second argument is inserted in the place referred by the first
## It also accepts any number of even arguments


# **do** macro is the fundamental iteration operator in Lisp
## first argument is a list of variable specifications. Each element of the form **(variable initial update)**
## second argument should be one or more expressions
### first expression is used to test whether iteration should stop
### the remaining expressions will be evaluated in order when the iteration stops. And the value of the last will be returned.
## the remining arguments comprise the body of the loop. They will be evaluated, in order, on each iteration

# **progn** takes any number of expressions, evaluates them in order, and returns the value of last
# lisp has simpler iteration operators for special cases
