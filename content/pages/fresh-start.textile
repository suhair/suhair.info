h1. My new blog powered by Nesta

I used to blog in the past using Microsoft's Oxite and then using a custom made one that never emerged from the private beta phase :). Lately I have been experimenting with Ruby stack of development and came to know about the Nesta ruby project. I am excited about its features and well, it is now the blogging engine for my site.
