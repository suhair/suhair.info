h1. RemoteAttribute

@RemoteAttribute@ can be constructed from the following arguments

# Action name, controller name, and area name
# Action name and controller name
# Route name

@RemoteAttribute@ creates @RouteData@ property from the given constructor arguments.

The static method @FormatPropertyForClientValidation@ prepends the given property with an asterisk (*) and a dot (.). The instance method @FormatAdditionalFieldsForClientValidation@ returns comma delimited string of validation field names. @RemoteAttribute's@ @IsValid@ property always returns @true@.

@GetUrl@ is a protected method that can create the url string from the following arguments.

# @ControllerContext@
# RouteName 
# RouteData

Since RouteName is essential to figure out the url @GetUrl@ will throw an error if it could not find a valid one in the @RouteTable.Routes@ collection.

If it could not find a valid route for the given controller and action name, it will throw an error.
