h1. GlobalFilterCollection

@GlobalFilterCollection@ implements the following interfaces.

# @IEnumerable@
# @IEnumerable<Filter>@
# @IFilterProvider@

When a filter is added to this collection using the @Add@ method, it specifies the scope of the given @Filter@ as @FilterScope.Global@. @Add@ may be called with or without providing an order and in the former case it is assigned a value of -1.

@getFilters@ method, coutesy of @IFilterProvider@, simply returns all of the added filters.

MVC has one static @GlobalFilters@ class instantiates the @GlobalFilterCollection@ class and exposes through @Filters@ property which in turn is added in to the @FilterProviderCollection@ inside the static constructor of @FilterProviders@.
